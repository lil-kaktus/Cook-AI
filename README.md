this my first react project ever, made all by myself with little to no help. i got the idea from a react tutorial i follow (FreeCodeCamp - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4rFhThSX04), and wanted to try to create my own version without the tutorial's help. i'm pretty happy with the result, feel free to download the repo to try it :) (this app uses the ollama ai model -> https://ollama.com/, you'll have to download it first)
